In this quiet space, we find our grace,

With whispered promises, in every trace.

Where you go I will go, I’ll never stray,

Your heart is my home, come what may.

With every step, our shadows merge, 

In kindred whispers, our souls emerge.


Where you lead, I follow with my heart,

In this journey together, we’ll never part.

Redemption shines in every loving glance,

Wrapped in peace, let’s take this chance.


Through the storms and the trials we face,

Your people will be my people, in every place.

With loyalty stitched in every tear, 

Together we’ll rise, conquering fear.

In the melody of trust, let’s dance,

With kindness as our everlasting chance.


Where you lead, I follow with my heart,

In this journey together, we’ll never part.

Redemption shines in every loving glance,

Wrapped in peace, let’s take this chance.


With you by my side, we’ll find our way,

In this love, forever we’ll stay.
